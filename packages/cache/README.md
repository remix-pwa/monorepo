# `@remix-pwa/cache`

`@remix-pwa/cache` is a thin wrapper around the browser's Cache Storage & Cache API that supercharges your normal browser cache with
LRU (least recently used) capabilities as well as expiration and versioning.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @remix-pwa/cache
```

## API

Check out the [repository](https://github.com/remix-pwa/monorepo) for more information on when the docs would be available.

In the meantime, feel free to play around with the library.
