          <article>
            Remix PWA evolution now includes loaders and actions that run solely on the worker thread. Utilizing esbuild
            in its new compiler, Remix PWA now seeks to provide a more robust and performant experience for developers.

          <article>
            Worker actions are much more wicked than their loader counterparts. That's also right, Remix PWA now intercepts 
            &nbsp;<b>everything</b>! Including <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, etc. requests. This means that you can now
            intercept all requests and do whatever you want with them. Click the link below to see it in <span className="underline">action</span>!

          <article>
            Worker loaders & actions aren't just restricted to your normal routes, they also work in pathless routes!
            And yes, they have the same behaviour as Remix normal loaders and actions in that they are nested and exhibit
            a waterfall effect. Make sure to 'Log in' else unknown horrors awaits!

            Normally when you have no network and something fails, if it isn't something cached like a page or data, you get 
            an error and that's it. What if I submitted something? Or requested something? The user had to manually retry again.

          <article>
            Remix PWA now allows you to cache directly in your routes. Talk about finetuning your app's performance!
            In this demo, we would be caching the response from the server and returning it if it's available. If not,
            we would be returning the client's response instead. This is a very powerful feature that allows you to
            cache your responses directly in your routes. See you on the other side of the link üöÄ!

            Remix PWA has embraced the strategy approach since <code>remix-pwa@v2</code> and we haven't let go in the next major

          <article>
            We have so far been using strategy wrappers to interact with the cache, a cache that seems super-charged thanks to its 
            new capabilities. How about we dive a bit deeper under the hood and tinker with stuffs by ourselves? Remix PWA is 
            against too much abstraction and we abstract only when deemed necessary, meaning you can say hello 
            to <code>@remix-pwa/cache</code>! The package that makes all of this possible.
