          <h3 className="font-medium text-lg">How does it work?</h3>
          <p className="indent-5 px-1">
            Remix PWA service workers intercept <b>all</b> fetch requests made, previously we were only dealing
            with GET requests and if they weren't, we would just let them pass through. That behaviour is still
            the default, but now we are introducing the ability to intentionally intercept them and do whatever you want to.
          </p>
          <p className="indent-5 px-1">
            Whenever a non-GET fetch request is made to a route that has an action, the service worker 
            will call the <code>workerAction</code> function if it exists. If it doesn't exist, it will just let the request 
            pass through like normal. If it does however, it will invoke the <code>workerAction</code> function
            which can now call the actual Remix action, modify the response, or do whatever you want to do.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="mt-6">
          <h3 className="font-medium text-lg">See the behaviour in action</h3>
          <p className="indent-5 px-1">
            Click the 'Submit' button below to trigger the action.
          </p>
          <p className="indent-5 px-1">
            By default, the <code>action</code> in this route returns a redirect response to a route that doesn't exist.
            Don't believe me? Comment out the worker action and re-submit. You'll see the redirect happen.
            Instead of redirecting though, we now see a message from the worker action instead.
          </p>
          <p className="indent-5 px-1">
            Open up the 'Cookies' section in your devtools and you'll see that the <code>actionData</code> cookie
            set by the <code>action</code> redirect. Actions still run like normal, but we are now able to modify
            the response and extend the functionality of Remix Actions like never before.
